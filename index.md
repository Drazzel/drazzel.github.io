I'm Drazzel Feliu. I am the Sr. Policy Analyst at the Center for Tax & Budget Accountability. I have a master's degree in public policy (MPP) from the University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy and a bachelor's degree in economics (BA) from Fordham University.

My policy focuses are in public finance, housing policy, and urban economics and the intersection of all of these areas with race.

This site is a portfolio of research ideas and odds & ends. As such, it'll include some visualizations, some data analysis, and generally work that I find interesting. The site may also include some tutorials on programming in R. I like to share what I learn.
